            <h2>Brief Introduction to RO(C<sub>2</sub>)-graded cohomology</h2><br>

            <h4>Representation spheres</h4>
      <p>
        For \(\small{G =C_2}\), the cyclic group of order two, any real representation \(\small{V}\) decomposes as
        \[V \cong \mathbb{R}^{p,q} = (\mathbb{R}_{\text{triv}})^{\oplus p-q} \oplus (\mathbb{R}_{\text{sgn}})^{\oplus q}\]
        where \(p\) is the topological dimension of \(\small{V}\) and \(q\) is the weight or twisted-dimension.  We write
        \(\small{S^V = S^{p,q}}\) for the representation sphere given by the one-point compactification of \(\small{V}\).  Below are
        some low-dimensional examples.  Here \(\small{S^{1,1}}\) and \(\small{S^{2,1}}\) have the \(\small{C_2}\)-action given by
        reflection across an equator and \(\small{S^{2,2}}\) has the \(\small{C_2}\)-action given by rotation about the axis through
        the north and south poles.

        <img src=RepSpheresBlue2.png class=center style="width:600px;height:auto;">

        For any virtual representation \(\small{V}\) and \(\small{C_2}\)-space \(\small{X}\), we write \(\small{H^{p,q}(X;\underline{\mathbb{F}_2})}\)
        for the \(\small{RO(C_2)}\)-graded cohomology of \(\small{X}\) with coefficients in the constant \(\small{\mathbb{F}_2}\)-valued Mackey
        functor.
      </p>

      <h4>The cohomology of a point</h4>
      <p>
        The bigraded cohomology of a point with the trivial action \(\small{\mathbb{M}_2 = H^{*,*}(pt;\underline{\mathbb{F}_2})}\)
        is depicted below.  A more detailed depiction is on the left, though it is often easier to work with the more succinct version on the right.
        Here every lattice point inside the cones represents a copy of \(\small{\mathbb{F}_2}\).  There are unique nonzero elements
        \(\small{\rho \in H^{1,1}(pt)}\) and \(\small{\tau \in H^{0,1}(pt)}\).  The top cone of \(\small{\mathbb{M}_2}\) is the polynomial ring
        \(\small{\mathbb{F}_2[\rho,\tau]}\).  The bottom cone has a unique nonzero element \(\small{\theta \in H^{0,-2}(pt)}\), which is
        infinitely divisible by both \(\small{\rho}\) and \(\small{\tau}\), and satisfies \(\small{\theta^2=0}\).

        <img src=M2.jpg class=center style="width:500px;height:auto;">
      </p>
    

            <h4>Examples</h4>
      <p>
        For any \(\small{C_2}\)-space \(\small{X}\), there is always an equivariant map \(\small{X \to pt}\).  This makes the \(\small{RO(C_2)}\)-graded
        cohomology \(\small{H^{*,*}(X;\underline{\mathbb{F}_2})}\) into a bigraded \(\small{\mathbb{M}_2}\)-module.  For example, let \(\small{S^n_a}\)
        be the \(n\)-dimensional sphere with the antipodal action.  Its cohomology as an \(\small{\mathbb{M}_2}\)-module is shown below.  Again a
        more detailed depiction is on the left and a more succinct version is on the right.  Diagonal lines represent multiplication by
        \(\small{\rho}\) and vertical lines represent multiplication by \(\small{\tau}\).  As an \(\small{\mathbb{M}_2}\)-module
        \(\small{H^{*,*}(S^n_a)} \cong \mathbb{F}_2[\tau,\tau^{-1},\rho]/(\rho^{n+1})\).

        <img src=An.jpg class=center style="width:400px;height:auto;">

        Up to equivariant isomorphism, there are six \(\small{C_2}\)-actions on the genus one torus.  Their cohomologies as
        \(\small{\mathbb{M}_2}\)-modules are depicted below.  These computations were joint work with Eric Hogle.

            <h4>Geometric representations</h4>
      <p>
        There are nice geometric representations of the elements \(\small{\rho}\), \(\small{\tau}\), and \(\small{\theta}\).  By a theorem of dos Santos, we can represent
        \(\small{H^{p,q}(-;\underline{\mathbb{F}_2})}\) by \(\small{K({\underline{\mathbb{F}_2}(p,q)) \simeq \underline{\mathbb{F}_2}\langle S^{p,q} \rangle}}\).
        This is the usual Dold-Thom model of configurations of points on the representation sphere \(\small{S^{p,q}}\) with labels in \(\small{\mathbb{F}_2}\).
        The basepoint in this model is a sink-source and when points collide their labels add.  Both \(\small{\rho}\) and \(\small{\theta}\) factor as

        <img src=RhoTheta.jpg class=center style="width:500px;height:auto;">

        where \(\small{\iota}\) is the canonical map sending each point \(\small{x}\) to the configuration \(\small{[x]}\).  Here \(\small{\tilde{\rho}}\)
        is the inclusion of the fixed-set, which is depicted below.


        <img src=RhoTildeBlue.png class=centerImage>

        The map \(\small{\tilde{\theta}}\) is the quotient map.  Finally, the element \(\small{\tau}\) can be viewed as a map
        \(\small{S^{1,0} \to \mathbb{F}_2\langle S^{1,1} \rangle}\).  In particular, \(\small{\tau}\) can be viewed as
        a loop in the fixed set of \(\small{\mathbb{F}_2\langle S^{1,1} \rangle}\) as demonstrated by this
        <a href="Tau.gif">animation</a>.  The animation shows two particles that leave the sink-source,
        travel symmetrically around \(\small{S^{1,1}}\), and then collide and disappear.
