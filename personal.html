        <h3>Mathematical Journey</h3>
      <p>
  I didn't always know I wanted to be a mathematician.  My path to a PhD was a winding one.  I started college as an engineering major.  I changed majors and transferred several times, including a year spent at a community college.  I worked throughout college, sometimes having two or three jobs.  Ultimately, I earned my first undergraduate degree from UMass Boston, where I majored in sociology with a minor in math.<br><br>

  For a few years I worked at nonprofits and companies in Boston, taking classes on the side in sociology, philosophy, psychoanalysis, and math.  I fell in love with math during a year-long abstract algebra course.  It was my first proof-based class and the most challenging course I had ever taken.  I was encouraged by my professor to consider graduate school, but I didn't feel prepared.<br><br>

  I saved up and went back to UMass Boston full-time for a second undergraduate degree in math.  Next I completed a one-year post-bacc program at NC State, a bridge program aimed at helping women get into graduate programs in math.  I went on to graduate school at the University of Oregon where I earned my PhD.  After that I spent a few years as a postdoc at UCLA and then moved to Norway to be a postdoc at NTNU. I am now a postdoc at the University of Bristol doing research in algebraic topology.<br><br>
